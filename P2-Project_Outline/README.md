# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is a basic blog app, designed to illustrate the basics of what I've learned about .NET and MySQL from LC101. 
My app will allow users to signup for individual accounts so that they can post blog entries that only they and the administrator can view and delete. 
Only the user associated with a given account may make changes to that user's blog entries.

### Features
* User login: Users can create and log into the app. Users will each have a profile page with their blog entries displayed.

* Create Post: Users can add new posts when logged in.

* Edit Post: Users can edit their own existing posts.

* Delete Post: Both the user and administrator will have the ability to remove posts.

### Technologies
* C# / ASP.NET Core Framework
* MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
While no new technologies are necessary for this project at this time, I am open to adding additional functionality later as deemed appropriate; 
this may require learning how to integrate with APIs or using JavaScript to add flair to the front-end.
